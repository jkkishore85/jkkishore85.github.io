# Creating Interactive Maps with R: A Beginner's Guide Using ggplot2 and Leaflet

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial where you'll learn how to create beautiful and interactive maps using R. We'll be using two powerful R packages: `ggplot2` for static maps and `leaflet` for interactive maps. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your mapping skills, this guide will walk you through the basics and provide some handy tips and tricks along the way.

## Introduction

Mapping is a crucial part of data visualization, helping to present geographic data in an easily understandable way. In this tutorial, we will: 1. Create a static map using `ggplot2`. 2. Create an interactive map using `leaflet`.

**When to Use Which:** 
- **ggplot2**: Ideal for static visualizations and publication-quality maps. 
- **Leaflet**: Perfect for interactive and dynamic maps that engage users.

By the end of this guide, you will have a good understanding of how to create and customize maps in R.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You will also need to install the necessary packages.

``` r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "leaflet", "maps", "htmlwidgets"))
```
