# Creating Interactive Maps with R: A Beginner's Guide Using ggplot2 and Leaflet

::: {.alert .alert-dismissible .alert-success}
**TL;DR** In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create static maps using `ggplot2` and interactive maps using `leaflet` in R. We'll cover the basics, provide code examples, and include tips and troubleshooting advice. By the end, you'll be able to create customized maps to visualize geographic data effectively.

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial where you'll learn how to create beautiful and interactive maps using R. We'll be using two powerful R packages: `ggplot2` for static maps and `leaflet` for interactive maps. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your mapping skills, this guide will walk you through the basics and provide some handy tips and tricks along the way.

## Introduction

Mapping is a crucial part of data visualization, helping to present geographic data in an easily understandable way. In this tutorial, we will:

1.  Create a static map using `ggplot2`.
2.  Create an interactive map using `leaflet`.

**When to Use Which:**
-   **ggplot2**: Ideal for static visualizations and publication-quality maps.
-   **leaflet**: Perfect for interactive and dynamic maps that engage users.

By the end of this guide, you will have a good understanding of how to create and customize maps in R.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You will also need to install the necessary packages.

``` r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "leaflet", "maps", "htmlwidgets"))
```
## Creating a Static Map with ggplot2

### Step 1: Load the Libraries

First, load the required libraries.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)  # Contains geographic data
```
### Step 2: Load the Data
For this tutorial, we'll use the built-in maps package which contains data for various maps, including world maps.

```r
world_map <- map_data("world")

```
### Step 3: Create the Map
We'll use ggplot2 to plot the world map.

```r
ggplot(world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "World Map", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")

```
::: {.card .border-info .mb-3}
***Explanation***
  - aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group): This sets the aesthetics for the map, mapping longitude and latitude to the x and y axes.
  - geom_polygon(): This draws the polygons that make up the countries.
  - theme_minimal(): This applies a minimal theme to the plot.
  - labs(): This adds titles and labels to the plot.
