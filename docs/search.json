    "text": "Shiny Dashboard \nMALDIViz: A Comprehensive Informatics Tool for MALDI-MS Data Visualization and Analysis\nMALDIViz is a comprehensive informatics tool designed to address the challenges posed by the large datasets generated by high-throughput screening (HTS) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). This technique is widely used in HTS due to its low cost, speed, and automation capabilities.\nThe complexity of the experimental data, such as screening many different sorbent phases, the sorbent mass, and the load, wash, and elution conditions, makes manual data analysis difficult. To overcome these challenges, MALDIViz was developed.\nMALDIViz is an R-Shiny-based web application, accessible independently of the operating system and without the need to install any program locally. It has been designed to facilitate easy analysis and visualization of MALDI-MS datasets, comparison of multiplex experiments, and export of the analysis results to high-quality images.\nKey Features:\n\nData Visualization: MALDIViz provides a robust platform for visualizing complex MALDI-MS datasets. This feature allows users to gain insights from their data in a graphical format, making it easier to interpret and understand the results.\nStatistical Analysis: The tool includes built-in functions for performing statistical analysis on the data. This can help users identify significant patterns and trends in their datasets.\nComparison of Multiplex Experiments: MALDIViz allows users to compare results from multiple experiments. This can be particularly useful when trying to understand the effects of different variables on the results.\nHigh-Quality Image and Data Export: Users can export the analysis results as high-quality images¹. This feature makes it easy to share the results with others or use them in presentations and reports.\nAccessibility: MALDIViz is an R-Shiny-based web application, which means it can be accessed independently of the operating system and without the need to install any program locally.\n\n\n\n\nMALDIViz: Workflow and Features\n\n\nThese features make MALDIViz a versatile and powerful tool for researchers working with MALDI-MS data. It was published in the journal SLAS DISCOVERY: Advancing Life Sciences R&D(Jagadeesan and Ekström 2017)¹.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJagadeesan, Kishore Kumar, and Simon Ekström. 2017. “MALDIViz: A Comprehensive Informatics Tool for MALDI-MS Data Visualization and Analysis.” SLAS Discovery 22 (10): 1246–52. https://doi.org/10.1177/2472555217727517."

    "text": "Project Page    Source Code \nIntroducing PrAna: A Powerful Tool for Analysing England’s NHS Primary Care Prescribing Data\nIn the realm of healthcare and environmental science, understanding the consumption of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is crucial. PrAna emerges as a ground breaking tool that brings a new dimension to the analysis of England’s NHS primary care prescribing data.\nDeveloped as an R package, PrAna is designed to aggregate and normalize England’s national level prescription data. It calculates the total prescribed quantity of different APIs, using open source statistical software R language. This data is vital for predicting the total amount of APIs released into the environment.\nPrAna is complemented by a user-friendly interactive tool, PrAnaViz, developed using the R/Shiny framework. This tool allows users to explore and visualize the spatio-temporal trends of the total prescribed quantity of APIs. Users can also download the results in various data formats for their further studies.\nWith PrAna and PrAnaViz, users can visualize, explore, and report different spatio-temporal and long-term prescription trends for wider use. This can be used as a support tool for policy-makers, academics, researchers in public healthcare, and environmental scientists to monitor different groups of pharmaceuticals emitted to the environment and for prospective risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in the environment.\nPublished in the esteemed journal BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making(Jagadeesan et al. 2022), PrAna is a significant contribution to the field, empowering researchers to efficiently handle and interpret complex prescription data.\nExplore the Features of PrAna\nPrAna is packed with features that make it a versatile tool for any researcher working with England’s NHS primary care prescribing data:\n\nData Aggregation and Normalization: Transform your complex prescription datasets into easy-to-understand formats.\nAPI Consumption Calculation: Calculate the total prescribed quantity of different APIs, vital for predicting the total amount of APIs released into the environment.\nInteractive Visualization: Explore and visualize the spatio-temporal trends of the total prescribed quantity of APIs with PrAnaViz.\nData Export: Download the results in various data formats for your further studies.\nAccessibility: Access PrAna from any operating system without the need for local installation.\n\nWith PrAna, navigating through the complexities of England’s NHS primary care prescribing data has never been easier.\nPrAnaViz\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJagadeesan, Kishore Kumar, James Grant, Sue Griffin, Ruth Barden, and Barbara Kasprzyk-Hordern. 2022. “PrAna: An R Package to Calculate and Visualize England NHS Primary Care Prescribing Data.” BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 22 (1). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01727-z."

By leveraging these tools, you can effectively communicate geographic data to your audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Mistakes\n\n\n\nWhen creating maps in R, there are a few common mistakes that can lead to errors or unexpected results. Here are some tips to help you avoid these pitfalls:\n\nWrong Coordinates: Ensure your longitude and latitude values are correct; otherwise, your markers will not appear where expected.\nMissing Libraries: Always load the necessary libraries before running your code.\nIncorrect Data Types: Make sure your longitude and latitude columns are numeric. If they are factors or characters, convert them using as.numeric().\nMismatched Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS): Ensure your spatial data and map layers use the same CRS to avoid misalignment.\nOverlapping Layers: Be careful with the order of layers in ggplot2. Layers added later will be on top of earlier ones, which might obscure important data.\nImproper Aesthetics Mapping: Double-check that the aes() function correctly maps your data columns to aesthetics in ggplot2.\nForgetting to Print the Plot: In scripts or R Markdown documents, ensure you explicitly print the ggplot object to render the plot.\nLarge Data Sets: For very large spatial data sets, rendering can be slow. Consider simplifying your data or using more efficient packages like sf.\nIncorrect File Paths: When loading spatial data from files, ensure the file paths are correct and the files are accessible.\nNot Saving Plots: If you want to save your plots, use functions like ggsave() for ggplot2 maps and htmlwidgets::saveWidget() for leaflet maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\nWhen things go wrong, here are some troubleshooting tips to help you diagnose and fix common issues:\n\nError: Object not found: Ensure all objects (e.g., data frames, variables) are defined in your environment.\nMap not displaying: Check your longitude and latitude values and ensure your map container is correctly set up if embedding in a Shiny app or R Markdown document.\nIncorrect CRS: If your spatial data doesn’t align, check and transform CRS using functions like st_transform() from the sf package.\nSlow Performance: If rendering is slow, consider reducing the complexity of your spatial data, using faster algorithms, or rendering smaller sections of the map.\nLayer Ordering Issues: If some layers are hidden, reorder your ggplot2 layers to ensure that important data is not obscured.\nLibrary Conflicts: Sometimes, functions from different libraries can conflict. Ensure you are calling functions with the correct namespace (e.g., ggplot2::geom_point()).\nMissing Data: Check for NA values in your data, especially in critical columns like longitude and latitude. Handle missing data appropriately.\nPlot Size: If your plot appears squished or improperly scaled, adjust the plot dimensions using ggsave() or fig.width and fig.height in R Markdown.\nBrowser Compatibility: For leaflet maps, ensure you are using a compatible web browser, and try refreshing the page if the map does not load.\nDependency Issues: Make sure all necessary packages and their dependencies are installed and up to date. Use install.packages() to install missing packages.\nResource Limits: For interactive maps, ensure your system has sufficient resources (memory, processing power) to handle large datasets and complex visualizations."
