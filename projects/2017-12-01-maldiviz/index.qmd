**MALDIViz**: A Comprehensive Informatics Tool for MALDI-MS Data Visualization and Analysis

`MALDIViz` is a comprehensive informatics tool designed to address the challenges posed by the large datasets generated by high-throughput screening (HTS) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). This technique is widely used in HTS due to its low cost, speed, and automation capabilities.

The complexity of the experimental data, such as screening many different sorbent phases, the sorbent mass, and the load, wash, and elution conditions, makes manual data analysis difficult. To overcome these challenges, `MALDIViz` was developed.

`MALDIViz` is an R-Shiny-based web application, accessible independently of the operating system and without the need to install any program locally. It has been designed to facilitate easy analysis and visualization of MALDI-MS datasets, comparison of multiplex experiments, and export of the analysis results to high-quality images.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Data Visualization**: `MALDIViz` provides a robust platform for visualizing complex MALDI-MS datasets. This feature allows users to gain insights from their data in a graphical format, making it easier to interpret and understand the results.

2.  **Statistical Analysis**: The tool includes built-in functions for performing statistical analysis on the data. This can help users identify significant patterns and trends in their datasets.

3.  **Comparison of Multiplex Experiments**: `MALDIViz` allows users to compare results from multiple experiments. This can be particularly useful when trying to understand the effects of different variables on the results.

4.  **High-Quality Image and Data Export**: Users can export the analysis results as high-quality images¹. This feature makes it easy to share the results with others or use them in presentations and reports.

5.  **Accessibility**: `MALDIViz` is an R-Shiny-based web application, which means it can be accessed independently of the operating system and without the need to install any program locally.
