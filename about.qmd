## About me

Hello! I’m Kishore Jagadeesan, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Chemistry, [University of Bath](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/kishore-jagadeesan), UK. I’m passionate about the environment, water quality, and public health.

My work primarily involves developing research tools for statistical analysis and visualization of massive datasets across many disciplines. I’m highly proficient in coding with R and HTML. One of my notable contributions is the development of `PERK`, an R/Shiny application tool that predicts and visualizes environmental concentration and risk using pharmaceutical prescription data collected at fine spatial resolution.

I’m always excited to connect with others who share similar interests. I’m also open to discussions about R Shiny, mass spectrometry, data visualization, and wastewater epidemiology.

For more information on my past work and contributions, feel free to explore my website and my GitHub profile. Thank you for visiting!
